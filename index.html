    Leonardo da Vinci was an Italian polymath of the Renaissance whose areas of
    interest included invention, drawing, painting, sculpting, architecture,
    science, music, mathematics, engineering, literature, anatomy, geology,
    astronomy, botany, writing, history, and cartography. He is widely
    considered one of the greatest painters of all time, despite perhaps only 15
    of his paintings having survived.
